    <p>• Setup •</p>
    <p>Line up six D6 dice adjacent to one another on a table. The dice lined up should read 6/5/4/3/2/1 from left to right. These are the “goals”.</p>
    <p>Use a separate D6 as your roll initial die.</p>
    <br>
    <p>• Gameplay •</p>
    <p>Roll the separate D6 die in an attempt to roll the current leftmost die. Attempts to roll that number should be equal to the number on the leftmost die. Ex. roll six times to get a six, five times to get a five, etc.</p>
    <p>If you successfully roll the number on the leftmost die within the attempts, move that die to the right of the rightmost die, and assign it as one number less than the rightmost die. Ex. if the rightmost die is a (1), change the new die to a (6) and place it to the right of the (1).</p>
    <p>If you unsuccessfully roll the number on the leftmost die within the attempts, add this goal die to your roll dice for the remainder of the game.</p>
    <p>The game ends when you either run out of goal dice or you achieve that very last goal (marked by the black square on the scorecard).</p>
    <br>
    <p>• Scoring •</p>
    <p>Start with noting the game number, year, month, and day.</p>
    <p>Each attempt at a goal for each round is marked by the circle with the line in it.</p>
    <p>When you roll an attempt, if you don't get the goal number, you fill in the left/top half of the circle.</p>
    <p>If you achieve the goal number, fill in that entire circle for that attempt.</p>
    <p>If you get to the last attempt to any goal and fail to achieve the goal number altogether, draw a perpendicular diagonal line inside the circle to make an “X”.</p>
    <p>When the game ends, make note of how many goals you successfully achieved.</p>
